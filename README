This version has larger heat sink working.

Still need some code cleanup to:
1) specify heat sink dimensions from outside and auto detect the start of laers etc
2) Use same parameter for generate_msh and generate_plot. The final solution shouldnt require modifying anything in these two files, everythng should be controlled from outside.
